[12/19/2020]

(many changes have been pending for over a year, so this list is probably not exhaustive)
(most changes should involve deprecating code with sensible backward compatibility for existing projects; there shouldn't be breaking changes, other than noted, but YMMV)

[Change Log]
	+ !BREAKING! Moved CollisionInfo into Collision namespace and AnimatedSprite into Animation namespace; you may need to add an Imports statement to existing code

	+ GameScene Name replaced with Title, which is now required and defaults to a unique value

	+ Collision moved into seperate namespace with classes for different collider shapes; old collision properties cause a circle collider to be created/configured

	+ Sprite refactored into IRenderable interface to facilitate creation of AnimatedSprite

	+ Adds RenderState to provide opportunity to bypass default rendering during Sprite.PreRender()

	+ Corrected/completed XML help text in several places

	+ Minor changes/corrections
