Abstract:
	This library is the result of many attempts at creating an easy to use and performant game engine
	for use in a Windows Forms project and benefits from my having spent a lot of time with Unity3D. As
	a result it provides an easy to use and versatile framework for creating a video game, while still
	providing respectable performance for the majority of the requirements of a "retro" video game.

	This framework is intended for hobbist programmers and/or students who want to create small games for
	their own personal use and/or limited distribution among friends.  That's not to say that the framework
	could not support a game of mass distribution, in theory it could, however it is not aimed at that and
	therefore doesn't claim to be suitable (for instance, there is no cross-platform support provided).

	PuppyBreath is a 2D rendering engine based on GDI+ graphics. While not supplied with the library,
	you could create classes to generated simulated 3D effects using 2D drawing techniques.
