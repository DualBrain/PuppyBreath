    <releaseNotes>Update to PuppyBreath alpha 0.2.0.0.
    !! This release contains minor breaking changes from alpha 0.1.x versions !!
    Existing code is easily updated by adding readily-available parameter values to method calls.
    No major refactoring is necessary.
    
    [Update Notes]
    + Finished intellisense comments
    + Added missing delegate members to GameObject
    + Changed GameObject.Destroy() method to take a GameState parameter
    + Changed the definition of IAnimation.Update() to include a reference to the target AnimatedSprite
    + Created VariableBank class and added instances to GameState and GameScene
    + Added scene change delegate members to GameScene
    + Added MultiImageAnimation
